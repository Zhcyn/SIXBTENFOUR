Fard is a long term calorie tracking app for iOS. Fard calculates a users total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), it then calculates that users total caloric burn and weight lost over a period of time allowing the user to monitor their progress and stay on track with their health and fitness goals. The current application is still under development, and some functions have not yet been implemented. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me
